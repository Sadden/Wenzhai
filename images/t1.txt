Abstract—Iopic modeling lias been widely used roi analyzing text document collections. Recently. tbeie have
been slg‘mﬁC’o\nt advaxlcslnems in vanous topic modeling tecbniques. pamculaily in tlie tom of piobabilisoc
giapblcal modeling. state—or-tlie-an teclmiques such as Latent Duicblet Allocation (LDA) liaye been successfully
applied In vlsual text analytics. However. most ortbe widely-used metliods based on piobabilistic modeling bave
drawbacks m terms of consistency riom multiple inns and empiiical conveigence. Fuitbeimoie. due to tbe
complicateduess in tbe roimulation and the algorithnl. LDA cannot easily incoipomte yailous types of usei
feedback. To tackle tlils pioblem. we pmpose a ieliable and ﬂexible visual analytlcs system rot topic modeling
called UTOPIAN (User-driven Toplc modellng based on lnteiactiye Nonnegative Matiui Factorization). centeied
aiound its semi-supervised roimulation UTOPIAN enables useis to inteiact with tbe topic modeling method and
steei tbe iesult in a usei-diiven mannlai. we demonstiate tbe capability of UTOPIAN Via seveial usage scenanos
with ieal—woild document Corpuses such as I.l1foV1s/VAST papei data set and pioduct ieview data seis
