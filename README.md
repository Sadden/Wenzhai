(an automatic abstract system based on web with OCR)
-------
This is my graduation project, an abstrct system. use struts2, Tesseract, Lucene and etc.
This system is designed for user to upload a picture with character content. The system will do OCR with the picture and get all kinds of information from the picture.
Then use these information, the system will make a index, and find the key words from the content it has, which are taken as tag.
So the user can find picture by just input some fragment of the contenet in the picture.
